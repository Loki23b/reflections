When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i want to share my work or work in team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Other people work with public remote repository. I need full control on what and when i pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch is different branches of commits on ether local or remote.
    Clone is copy from remote or local to local of full repository including all branches.
    Fork is copy of full repository from someones remote to my remote with some information about it's origin.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Safety. I always can compare my difference. I'm nut totally sure here.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use Dropbox and try to keep different workspace for different people
    Merging theres work together would be difficult.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Different branch is for times when i am not owner of the project.
    My proposed changes must be reviewed before merging into master branch.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Hidden folder .git with git metadata got created and now this folder is
	a repository with 0 commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area exists only in memory and git metadata. It is neather whole
	repository nor directory. It offers control on what to add and what not
	to add to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	I can add only some of changed files to staging arrea before commit
	and then others for another commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	When i need to make many changes to two versions separetly. I can create
	branch for each version with each own history of commits and i can 
	switch between them with checkout command.
